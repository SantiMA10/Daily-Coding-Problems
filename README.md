# Daily Coding Problems

At 07/07/2018 I was surfing the Internet when I found [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), a web which sends you a tailored coding problems every day which was asked on a top company interview, like Google, Facebook...

As part of my intent of become a better developer I decided to start solving these problems with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and testing the output solutions with [JestJS](https://jestjs.io/)

## Base

The **day#** folder contains the base schema for all the problems.
```
README.md // with the problem
resolver.ts // with the code to solve the problem
resolver.spect.ts // with the tests
```
